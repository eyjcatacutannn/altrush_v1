Fast forward. Rewind. Doesn't matterâ€”this shoe takes retro into the future. The V2K remasters everything you love about the Vomero in a look pulled straight from an early '00s running catalogue. Layer up in a mixture of flashy metallics, referential plastic details and a midsole with a perfectly vintage aesthetic. And the chunky heel makes sure wherever you go, it's in comfort.
